### How to contribute to Drawpile

If you'd like to contribute to Drawpile, then you've come to the right place.
Here we will go over a variety of ways you can help the project with development, and without!

If you'd like to take on a task or work on an area, we strongly recommend getting in contact with us and the other members in our community, to avoid conflicts or potentially working on something that is already being worked on.
This is especially important when it comes to the network protocol or similar pillar components because of the potential for merge conflicts, which can be avoided if we know what you're working on.
You can find out how to get in contact [on the main help page](https://drawpile.net/help/).

Read [the architecture page](architecture) to become familiar with the different components, and check out our [coding guidelines](https://docs.drawpile.net/help/development/codingguidelines) for general but very useful guidelines.

## Non-Development Contribution

These wouldn't require you to be a software developer. Some may still be technical, but a lot less so.

### Helping Other Users

Users come to ask questions about Drawpile on our [Discord](https://drawpile.net/discord/) and [libera.chat](https://drawpile.net/irc/). 
If you know your way around Drawpile and want to help others this way, you can hang around help respond to those kinds of questions.

### Providing Illustrations

You may have noticed that the Drawpile website is pretty thin on illustrations. It would be great to have some for decoration or to showcase features, issues or bugs!

If you've drawn artworks or prepared showcases that you would like Drawpile to us, [contact us](https://drawpile.net/help/)! 

The works provided should naturally come with your consent to use, and ideally be put under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/).
They should of course be made at least for the most part in Drawpile and shouldn't contain any canon characters or intellectual property.

### Reporting Problems, Suggesting Features

When you find a bug or some other problem or have an idea for a good feature, bring it up! This is how Drawpile improves. 
Don't worry about reporting duplicates, it doesn't hurt to hear things brought up again and might end up as a good reminder to get to them.
If the matter is already brought up in for example a GitHub issue, feel free to add your thoughts or elaboration to it!

### Translations

Drawpile is used all across the world, by people speaking many different languages. 
If you want to translate it into yours or fix something about an existing translation, you can do so [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/drawpile/).
You can see which languages there are already and how complete the translations are. If you don't spot your language, you can add a new one.

### Community Servers

Drawpile has a set of [community servers](https://drawpile.net/communities/). These are servers run by and moderated by people who want to give a space for others to draw. 
If you have your own Drawpile server that you want to become one of these community servers, you can [submit it here](https://drawpile.net/communities/drawpile.net/ych/).

If you want to help moderate existing Drawpile servers, feel free to [contact us](https://drawpile.net/help/). 

### Documentation

You can contribute to this help page by writing documentation! 
If you know your way around, you can send pull requests [to the drawpile.github.io repository](https://github.com/drawpile/drawpile.github.io). 
Otherwise, you can just write up an article in your favorite word processor and send it over to us! 



## Development Contribution

These are areas that need some software development skills. 
We've compiled the ideas into a large backlog, and created their corresponding GitHub issue.

### Development Backlog

All items in the following chart **should** exist as issues on our GitHub; you can check their current status by clicking them.
Note that this list isn't updated in real time, but is updated often enough for you to pick an area to contribute.
